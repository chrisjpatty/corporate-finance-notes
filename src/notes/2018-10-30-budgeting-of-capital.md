**Budgeting of Capital** - The process of making decisions about how to use capital. The process of analyzing projects and making decisions about them.

# Categories

* **Expansion**
  * Expanding the business, which could include opening new stores.
* **Replacement**
  * Replacing previous assets. Replacing olde equipment, etc.
* **Contraction**
  * When you get rid of expensive projects etc. Usually done to cut costs
* **Safety/Environmental**
  * Green initiatives.
* **Mergers & Acquisition**
  * Buying other companies, etc.

# Conceptual

* We are interested in **Net Cash Flows** and not accounting income. We are going to add back in depreciation, because there is a tax shield associated with it.
* We are going to **ignore interest** because we've already incorporated the interested into our Weighted Average Cost of Capital.
* Don't incorporate **Sunk Costs** into your decision making.
* Do incorporate **Opportunity Costs**.
* **Etranalities**:
  * **Erosion/Canibalization** is when you compete with yourself to your detriment.

# Estimating Cash Flows

## OCF Methods

* Most Common OCF = **EBIT** + **Depreciation**  - **Taxes**
  * **Sales - Costs - Depreciation = EBIT**
  * **EBIT - Tax = Net Income**
  * Downside is that we have to reconstruct income statements.
* Top-Down OCF = **Sales - Costs - Taxes**
* Bottom-Up OCF = **Net Income + Depreciation**
* Tax-Shield OCF = (**Sales ** - **Costs**)(**1** - **Tax Rate**) + **Depreciation** x **Tax Rate**
  * CF without Depreciation
