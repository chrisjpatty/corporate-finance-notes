**\*The NPV trumps the IRR when trying to decide between two possible projects. Go with the one with the higher NPV, but if they're the same, go with the higher IRR.**

**\*Any rate lower than the cross over rate will cause a conflict between the IRR & the NPV.**

## To find the cross over rate

* Find the difference between the cash flows
* Solve for the IRR of that difference. 
* This will be on the test ^
  * "If the WACC is this rate, will there be a conflict between our decision making tools? (NPV vs IRR)?"
