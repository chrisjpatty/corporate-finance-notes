One the test:

* Black Schulls Option Pricing
* Know what each of the decision tools is.
* NPV is the initial cost + the present value of all future cash flows.
* Know all of the pros and cons for each of the decision tools
  * Payback period:
    * Cons:
      * We're ignoring any cashflow that goes beyond the payback period. 
      * This means you could wrongfully reject projects that would be making money, but after the payback period.
  * Modified Internal Rate of Return
    * Pros
      * Considers time-value of money
      * We assume reinvestment at the cost of capital, not at the IRR, which would be a quote, "lofty assumption".
    * Cons:
      * Computationally challenging.
      * Must be interpreted relative to the required rate of return.
* Crossover Rate:
  * **\* Any cost of capital less than the crossover rate, is going to cause a conflict between our two decision tools, IRR and NPV.** 
  * On the test you're going to have to create the tables for finding the crossover rate.
    * You solve for the IRR of the difference between the cashflows of the two projects.
* NPV is _generally_ the superior decision tool. Buuuut, if your NPV is 0, it means that your return equals your cost of capital, so you may need other decision tools to figure it out.
* If you see MIRR (Modified Internal Rate of Return), you need to draw a timeline.
