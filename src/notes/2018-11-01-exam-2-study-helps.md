## One the test:

* Black Schulls Option Pricing will be on the test. It's time consuming, so make sure you practice it. Spot price is the price of the underlying asset today.
* Know what each of the decision tools is.
* NPV is the initial cost + the present value of all future cash flows.
* Know all of the pros and cons for each of the decision tools
  * Payback period:
    * Cons:
      * We're ignoring any cashflow that goes beyond the payback period. 
      * This means you could wrongfully reject projects that would be making money, but after the payback period.
  * Modified Internal Rate of Return
    * Pros
      * Considers time-value of money
      * We assume reinvestment at the cost of capital, not at the IRR, which would be a quote, "lofty assumption".
    * Cons:
      * Computationally challenging.
      * Must be interpreted relative to the required rate of return.
* Crossover Rate:
  * **\* Any cost of capital less than the crossover rate, is going to cause a conflict between our two decision tools, IRR and NPV.** 
  * On the test you're going to have to create the tables for finding the crossover rate.
    * You solve for the IRR of the difference between the cashflows of the two projects.
* NPV is _generally_ the superior decision tool. Buuuut, if your NPV is 0, it means that your return equals your cost of capital, so you may need other decision tools to figure it out.
* If you see MIRR (Modified Internal Rate of Return), you need to draw a timeline.
  * On that timeline, any negative value you see, bring it back to the beginning (discount it back). Any positive cash flow, you're moving out to the end.
* Know the different types of options:
  * Expansion
  * Investment timing
  * Flexibility
  * Abandonment
* Know the difference between a real option, and a financial option.
* You **don't** have to calculate multiple IRRs (quadratic formula).

## Ch. 10

* Problem #5 is **not** on the test.
* Understand what an expansion project is. (Be able to identify which thing out of a list is an expansion project).
* Know the difference between Net Cash Flow & Accounting income
  * NCF adds back in depreciation and ignores interest expense because we've already incorporated interest expense into the Weighted Average Cost of Capital.
* Know what an incremental cash flow is.
* Sunk Costs
* Opportunity costs
* Extranalities 
  * Within the firm and without the firm.
  * Definitely know cannibalization.
* There will be 2 work-out problems from this chapter, and they will both be similar to #3 and #4. 
* Anything going along with the price of equipment, (price of installation, training, etc.) Is all depreciable. 
* When liabilities go up, cash goes up.
* When inventory goes up, cash goes down.
* The **tax shield OCF** is just sales minus (all of your costs, it could be fixed costs, or others. It's just **all** of your costs).
