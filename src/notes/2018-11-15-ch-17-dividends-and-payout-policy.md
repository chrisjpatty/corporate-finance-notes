# Dividends

A **dividend** is a payout of earnings to stockholders.

Dividends are considered **sticky**.

Types of cash dividends:

* **Regular** cash dividend - The normal _sticky_ dividend payout policy
* **Extra** cash dividend - If there's extra earnings they can pay additional dividends, but the normal dividend payout policy likely won't change.
* **Special** cash dividend - When you decide to increase the dividend payout for a single quarter or other period, but then return to the normal payout policy.
* **Liquidating** cash dividend - When the company is selling assets in order to pay you.
