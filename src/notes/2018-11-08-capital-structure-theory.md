## Case 1: No Taxes & No Bankruptcy Costs

1. Markets are frictionless
2. Individuals & firms borrow at the same rate
3. No information asymmetries.

**Prop I.** Capital structure is irrelevant.

**Prop II.** The cost of equity is increasing with the proportion of debt.

## Case 2: Corporate Taxes & No Bankruptcy Costs

**Prop I.** Firm value is increasing with debt because of the tax shield.

**Prop II.** Cost of equity increases with the proportion of debt, but WACC is decreasing.

## Case 3: Corporate Taxes & Bankruptcy Costs

**Prop I.** Marginal cost of debt (bankruptcy) > Marginal benefit of debt tax shield.

Prop II.
