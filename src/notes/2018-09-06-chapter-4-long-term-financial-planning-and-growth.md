# Elements of a Financial Plan

1. Forecast sales
2. Investment (increase) in new assets
3. Degree of financial leverage
   1. How does the firm support that growth in assets
4. The amount of cash that the firm thinks is appropriate to pay to shareholders (dividends)
5. The amount of working capital that the company needs to maintain

# Creating Pro-Forma or "Forecasted" Financial Statements

* The 3 external accounts
  * Notes Payable
  * Longterm Debt
  * Common Stock
* Cheapest forms of financing
  1. Retained earnings
  2. Then debt (Because interest on debt is tax deductible)
  3. Common stock is the more expensive form of financing.
* Total equity = Common stock + Retained Earnings

## Pro forma balance sheet

* Equity is equal to the equity on the previous year plus the addition to retained earnings.
* If your addition to retained earnings plus the equity doesn't balance the pro-forma balance sheet, you have a few options. You can take on debt, or sell common stock.
  * (This is how the firm supports the growth of assets)

## Internal Growth Rate

* This is the maximum rate at which we can grow without external financing.
* (ROA * (1 - POR)) / (1 - (ROA x (1 - POR)))
  * Where ROA = (Net Income / Total Assets)

## Sustainable Growth Rate

* The maximum rate at which we can grow without external **equity** financing and holding the debt-to-equity ratio constant.
* The formula is identical to the internal growth rate, except ROA is substituted for ROE
* (ROE * (1 - POR)) / (1 - (ROE x (1 - POR)))
  * Where ROE = Net Income / Total Equity

## Retention Ratio (Or Plowback)

* Is equal to (1 - POR) 
* POR stands for Payout Ratio

## Full capacity sales

* The sales we can achieve if we are operating at full capacity. (without purchasing any more fixed assets)

## Max Growth Rate

* The largest we can grow our sales, without purchasing more fixed assets.
