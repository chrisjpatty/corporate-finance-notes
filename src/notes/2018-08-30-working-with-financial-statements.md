Price to Earnings (PE ration) ratio is a good indicator of the true price of a stock.

# 3 Statements of concern

* Balance sheet
* Income statement
* Statement of cash flows

## Balance sheet

### Left side

* Current and fixed assets
* Current assets:
  * Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory.
* Fixed:
  * Np & E

### Right side

* Current Liabilities:
  * Accruals
  * Accounts Payable (Debts)
  * Notes Payable (Debts from banks)
* Long-term debt (Municipal bonds, debt from banks, investors, etc...)
  * Owner's Equity:
    * Retained Earnings
    * Common Stock

## Income Statement

* Sales/Revenue
* Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
* Depreciation & Amortization
* EBIT (Earnings Before Interest & Tax)
* EBIT - Interest = EBT (Or operating income)
* EBT - Taxes = Net Income

## Statement of Cash Flows

* Cash Balance at the beginning of the year
* Operating activities:
  * Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization
  * Increase in Accounts Payable
  * An increase in assets is a decrease in cash
  * An increase in liabilities increase in cash ? (Huh?)
* Financing activities:
  * Decrease in NP
  * Decrease in Long term debt
  * Dividends paid
