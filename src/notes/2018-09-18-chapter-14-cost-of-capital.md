# What is capital?

* Capital consists of capital raised from debt, and capital raised from equity.
* **\* The price of a stock today, is the present value of all future cash flows**

## Common Stock

* You "technically" have voting rights, but they're usually proxied to the managers.

## Preferred Stock

* Has the first right to dividends.
* Almost always paid a dividend.
* Usually has no voting rights.

# Determining the cost of equity

## Dividend Growth Model (DGM)

* To note: The price of the stock today is equal to the present value of all future cash flows.
* **Advantages**:
  * Simplicity
* **Disadvantages**
  * This model only works if you pay a dividend. If you're a non-dividend-paying company, this won't work. 
  * Growth rate estimate must be accurate or your calculation will be way off.
  * Doesn't take into account risk.

## Geometric average growth rate

* Takes into account the time-value of money.

## Arithmetic average growth rate

* Does not take into account the time value of money.

## Security Market Line (SML)

* CAPM = E(R) = R<sub>f</sub> + B(R<sub>m</sub> - R<sub>p</sub>)

# Bonds

* For this class, we will assume that the face value of bonds is $1000.
* The coupon payment = Interest Rate Payment. This is the interest rate on the face value of the bond.
* The face value is the amount you will get after the bond matures.
* **Par**: Trading at face value.
* **Premium**: Trading above face value.
* **Discount**: Trading below face value.

# Weighted Average Cost of Capital

* **The weights are determined by market values, not by book values.**
