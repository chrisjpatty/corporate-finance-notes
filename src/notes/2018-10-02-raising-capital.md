# How dow we raise capital?

* Money invested from family members
* Take out a loan from a bank
* Private equity firms
* Venture capitalists

## Venture Capitalists

* Often a method of last resort since they generally demand a lot.
* Will often fire/replace your management team 
* Often want seats on your board of directors
* Often don't care about the long term, they want the company to be profitable within a few years.
* Often their goal is to make a fairly quick profit and then sell off their shares.
* To limit risk, VC's often provide money in stages rather than all at once.
* There's benefits to VC's, often their name carries wait. They may also benefit the company with publicity.

## Public Issue

* One big reason to go public is for **easier **and **cheaper** access to equity capital.
* Management gets approval by the board of directors.
* The firm files a **Registration Statement** with the SEC.
* The SEC looks at the registration statement during a **waiting period**.
* If everything is **copasetic** with the SEC, a price is set and a full-fledged selling effort starts.
* When multiple investment bankers are working on the same IPO, it's called a **syndicate**. 
  * This is a group of **underwriters**.
* If it's an **unsyndicated offer**, it means the **only 1** investment banker is taking the company public.
