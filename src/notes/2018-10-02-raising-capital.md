# How do we raise capital?

* Money invested from family members
* Take out a loan from a bank
* Private equity firms
* Venture capitalists

## Venture Capitalists

* Often a method of last resort since they generally demand a lot.
* Will often fire/replace your management team 
* Often want seats on your board of directors
* Often don't care about the long term, they want the company to be profitable within a few years.
* Often their goal is to make a fairly quick profit and then sell off their shares.
* To limit risk, VC's often provide money in stages rather than all at once.
* There's benefits to VC's, often their name carries wait. They may also benefit the company with publicity.

## Public Issue

* One big reason to go public is for **easier **and **cheaper** access to equity capital.
* Management gets approval by the board of directors.
* The firm files a **Registration Statement** with the SEC.
* The SEC looks at the registration statement during a **waiting period**.
* If everything is **copasetic** with the SEC, a price is set and a full-fledged selling effort starts.
* When multiple investment bankers are working on the same IPO, it's called a **syndicate**. 
  * This is a group of **underwriters**.
* If it's an **un-syndicated offer**, it means the **only 1** investment banker is taking the company public.

## Types of Public Issues

* **Firm commitment cash offer** - Company negotiates an agreement with an investment banker to underwrite and distribute the new shares. A specified number of shares are bought by underwriters and sold at a higher price.
* **Best efforts cash offer** - Company has investment bankers sell as many of the new shares as possible at the agreed-upon price. There is no guarantee about how much capital will be raised.
* **Dutch Auction cash offer** - The investment bankers auction shares to determine the highest offer price obtainable for a given number of shares to be sold. 
* **Direct rights offer** - The company offers the new stock directly to its existing shareholders. This avoids diluting your ownership. 

# IPO Underpricing

* There's an incentive to underprice an IPO a little bit.

# Stock Rights

* Why might a company have a rights offering rather than a general cash offer?
  * It's more cost effective to sell to existing investors.
  * You want current investors to have the chance to maintain their proportional ownership.
