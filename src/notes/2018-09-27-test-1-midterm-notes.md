* Know the net income you're generating for every $ of sales. (Du Pont equation?)
* If you have (Total Debt / Total Assets) of .60, then (Total Equity / Total Assets) would be .40, or (1 - (TD/TA))
  * Then, if you need (Total Assets / Total Equity), take the reciprocal by flipping both sides of the equation.
