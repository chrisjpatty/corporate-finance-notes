**\*The questions on the test will be in order by chapter (not shuffled)**

**\*There will probably be a "mulligan" allowed, so you can afford to miss one question for free.**

# Chapter 3

* Know your sources and uses of cash. 
* Know whether it's an operating, investing, or financing activity.
* Know the dupont equation. Know what each term means.
  * Profit margin, equity multiplier, etc...
* Know the financial planning process.
  * When creating a financial plan
    * First forecast sales.
    * Have an increase in assets
    * How do we buy those assets
      * We borrow, or use internal money
* Know the payout ratio: The percent we're paying out.
* Know the retention ratio: How much we're reinvesting into the company.
* Am I returning anything to my stockholders?
  * Look at the ROE

* Know the flow of an income statement
* The balance sheet is a snapshot in time.
  * Assets has to equal our debts plus our equity
* Statement of cash flows is important for the first two questions on the exam.
  * If there is an increase in Accounts Rec, there was a decrease in cashflows. This was an operating activity.
  * If an asset went up, it means cash went down.
  * If we have an increase in a liability, we have an increase in cash. 
  * Operating activities are cash, accounts receivables, inventories, etc.
  * Investing activities have to do with long-term fixed assets. 
  * Financing activities are dividends, issuing of stock, etc.
  * Question format: If there's an increase in accounts receivable, theres a \_\_\_\_\_ in \_\_\_\_\___.
* \* A common size income statement takes every line on the income statement and divides it by sales.
* If asked to solve for the common-size level of \[something], solve for sales if you don't have it, and then divide by sales.
* Know the net income you're generating for every $ of sales. (Du Pont equation?)
* If you have (Total Debt / Total Assets) of .60, then (Total Equity / Total Assets) would be .40, or (1 - (TD/TA))
  * Then, if you need (Total Assets / Total Equity), take the reciprocal by flipping both sides of the equation.
* You should know how to common size a balance sheet.
* There will be a question where you have to find net income by using the Du Pont equation. And you start with the Debt to Equity ratio. 

# Chapter 4

* You need to know the financial planning process.
* The first part of creating a financial plan is to forecast sales. (This is going to be the answer to one of the questions)
* "If you see _excess capacity_, you need to immediately think of '_full capacity sales_'".
* If your projected sales are less than your full capacity sales, then you have excess. 
* If your full capacity sales equals your projected sales, then your total amount of fixed assets is sufficient to operate at full capacity. If it's less, then you need to find out what your required level of fixed assets is to operate at full capacity.
  * To do this: ( Actual fixed assets) / Full Capacity Sales ) x Projected Sales = The required level of fixed assets (to operate at full capacity).
* There will be a problem where you'll need to use the Du Pont equation to find ROE.
* You need to know how to forecast financial statements. It will probably be similar to question 1 on the worksheet.

# Chapter 14

* R<sub>D</sub> is the Pre-Tax Cost of Debt.
* R<sub>D</sub>(1-T) is the After-Tax Cost of Debt.
* **If the tax rate increases, the after tax cost of debt goes down**
  * This will probably be almost verbatim on the test.
  * Our US financial system incentivizes using debt to get capital.
* **How do we measure the cost of preferred stock?**
  * It's the required rate of return on a perpetuity. (Probs on the test)

* The cost of debt is like the required rate of return on an annuity, but with a lump sum at the end.
